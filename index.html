                <p>Iwatani was born in Meguro ward of Tokyo, Japan.</p>
                <p>He was self-taught, without any formal training in computers, visual arts, or graphic design.</p>

                <p>Joined the computer software company Namco. It was here where he came up with the idea for a game called "Pakku-Man" which was the original title of the game as released to the Japanese public.</p>

                <p>On 22 May he finished the game, along with programmer Shigeo Funaki, a hardware engineer, a cabinet designer and Toshio Kai for sound and music.</p>
                <p>It caught the attention of arcade-game manufacturer Midway, who bought the United States rights for the game and released the game in the U.S. as Pac-Man. Due to its innovative concept and continuing international popularity, it is regarded as one of the all-time classic video games.</p>
                <p>Iwatani went on to create a few other video games, including Libble Rabble, but none of them reached the amount of success that Pac-Man did. He was promoted within the ranks of Namco, eventually being responsible for overseeing the administration of the company.</p>
                <p>In a VH-1 Game Break interview, Itawani said that, "The truth of the matter is, there were no rewards per se for the success of Pac-Man. I was just an employee. There was no change in my salary, no bonus, no official citation of any kind."</p>
