          <h2>Timeline of Toru's career and achievements</h2>
          
          <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li><b>1955</b> - Iwatani was born in Meguro ward of Tokyo, Japan.</li>
            <li>He was self-taught, without any formal training in computers, visual arts, or graphic design.</li>
            <li><b>1977</b> - Joined the computer software company Namco. It was here where he came up with the idea for a game called "Pakku-Man" which was the original title of the game as released to the Japanese public.</li>
            <li><b>1980</b> - On 22 May he finished the game, along with programmer Shigeo Funaki, a hardware engineer, a cabinet designer and Toshio Kai for sound and music.</li>
            <li>It caught the attention of arcade-game manufacturer Midway, who bought the United States rights for the game and released the game in the U.S. as Pac-Man. Due to its innovative concept and continuing international popularity, it is regarded as one of the all-time classic video games.</li>
            <li>Iwatani went on to create a few other video games, including Libble Rabble, but none of them reached the amount of success that Pac-Man did. He was promoted within the ranks of Namco, eventually being responsible for overseeing the administration of the company.</li>
            <li>In a VH-1 Game Break interview, Itawani said that, "The truth of the matter is, there were no rewards per se for the success of Pac-Man. I was just an employee. There was no change in my salary, no bonus, no official citation of any kind."</li>
            <li<b>198</b> - Iwatani's greatest success after Pac-Man was Pole Position, which became a major arcade hit and is considered the most influential racing video game of all time.</li>
            <li><b>2005</b> - He taught the subject of Character Design Studies at Osaka University of Arts as visiting professor.</li>
            <li><b>2007</b> - Left Namco in to become a full-time lecturer at Tokyo Polytechnic University.</li>
            <li><b>2010</b> - Iwatani received a certificate from Guinness World Records for Pac-Man having the most "coin-operated arcade machines" installed worldwide: 293,822.</li>
